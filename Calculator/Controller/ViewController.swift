    // may or may not be nill and swift is erroring for that reason.

    // ACCESS LEVELS most-to-least restrictive
    // 1.private - only accessible within curly braces of class
    // 2.fileprivate - only accessible inside the file where declared
    // 3.internal - accessible anywhere in current app module (DEFAULT)
    // 4.public - accessible from all other modules but cannot subclass or override
    // 5.open - = public+ accessible to other modules like public but
    //    also to be subclassed and overriden so anyone can do
    //    anything they want.
    // FOR STANDARD APP DEV, WE USE 1-3 BUT DEVS WORKING ON
    // FRAMEWORKS, LIBRARIES, SDKS, WILL USE 4-5 IN ORDER TO EXPOSE
    // THEM TO OTHER DEVS.
